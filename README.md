## Dynamically generated documentation of annotation extension relations

In an ideal world, everyone would be using a single system for editing and viewing all AE extension relation content. It's probably asking too much for that one place to be Protege, although we should pull as much as we can into the OWL file itself.  In the absence of this, we have a manually maintained [wiki](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_usage_examples_for_each_annotation_extension_relation).  We need to at least automate population of all content that is redundant with the OWL file. Work to do this is currently ongoing.
