# Annotation extension usage reports

This folder contains a set of tsv* reports of annotation extension usage generated from the GOA DB at the EBI.  Annotation extensions are all unrolled - meaning that all compound annotation extensions have been split into their component parts.

*tsv = tab separate value.  Files may be pasted straight into most spreadsheet software, including Excel.


* AE\_compact\_unrolled.tsv is a uniq'd list of annotation extensions with the columns: GO\_ID	GO\_NAME	ANNOTATION\_EXTENSION
* AE\_unrolled.tsv is a list of all annotations that have extensions, with extensions unrolled.  The columns are: SOURCE	GP\_ID	GO\_ID	GO\_NAME	ANNOTATION\_EXTENSION	EVIDENCE	REF\_TYPE	REF\_ACC
