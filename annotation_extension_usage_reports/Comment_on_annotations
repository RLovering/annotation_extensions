Notes on relationships			
What is in each worksheet			
All AEs	This lists all the current GOC annotations that include AE data, if an annotation has more than one AE row/statement then each piece of information is given an individual annotation row.		
Dependent_on	This lists all the current GOC annotations that include AE data using the dependent_on relationship (which is due to be obsoleted). '1' was added to select examples representing each group of annotations with GO terms and IDs in common		
Dependent_on + info	As above, but only the annotations selected are included. Plus for a selection of these the GO term/protein name/chemical name etc associated with the Go/Protein/ChEBI etc ID is also provided		
In_presence_of	This lists all the current GOC annotations that include AE data using the in_presence_of relationship (which is due to be obsoleted). 		
Examples to consider	This lists key examples from all of the sheets listed which need to be looked at and decisions made about how (and in some cases if) this information should be captured, what relationships should be used and limits to the IDs include		
Notes on relationship files	This worksheet provides a list of what is in all the worksheets as well as some additional key points that need to be discussed		
			
Many relationships still missing domain and range			
			
with the regulation of BPs or MFs why do we need to have 'regulation' included in relationship name as this is implied by the GO term?			
	eg reg of phosphorylation include: has agent and has subsrate, and get rid of regulation_target		
			
The has_agent file needs to be revised	But we don't think there is a need for has_agent, instead only a need for regulates_o_has_agent		
The has_agent usage seems to imply we can use this for a process, when actually it probably would only be used for the regulation of a process.			
For example you annotate protein A as being involved in the TCR signaling pathway, we don't think you are you going to use has_agent to list all the other proteins involved in the signaling pathway			
However if you annotate protein B as being involved in regulating the TCR signaling pathway, you might want to use has_agent to document that protein B regulates this pathway by regulating the activity of protein A (which is annotated as involved in the signaling pathway)			
We think that in this case you would annotate protein B as being involved in regulating the TCR signaling pathway, and use regulates_o_has_agent protein A to specify how the TCR signaling pathway is being regulated by Protein B.			
			
Current has_agent information:			
GO Annotation Domain: GO:0003674 (molecular_function) or GO:0008150 (biological_process)			
GO Annotation Range: CARO:0000000 (anatomical entity) or CL:0000000 (null) or GO:0005575 (cellular component) or GO:0005623 (cell) or PO:0025131 (plant anatomical entity) or UBERON:0001062 (metazoan anatomical entity) or WBbt:0004017 (null) or WBbt:0005766 (null)			
Usage: The relationship that links an entity with a process in which the entity participates in the process by serving as the continuant that is responsible for the execution of the process.			
has_agent range is completely wrong and doesn't include Protein IDs.			
The usage statement for has_agent implies not to be used for reg of BP eg the agent we want to use is the kinase, which is not the protein responsible for the regulation of the kinase.			
And the continuant in the definition is most likely the protein (eg) you are actually annotating, not the proteins being regulated by the protein annotated.			
			
Other queries re the relationships and documentation			
transports_or_maintains_localization_of	Looks like this is for processes only therefore annotations of transporters (MF) keep as has_direct_input		
results in movement of 	how can we make it more clear that this is not the term to use for proteins?		
annotations to secretion terms	secretion seems to relate to the final step in getting things secreted, rather than including all steps necessary for secretion to occur, so suggest this can include proteins/ChEBI IDs		
regulates_o_has_substrate	this would be a very useful relationship for the regulation extensions as it makes it clear what the implied role of the Protein/Chemical/etc (listed in the AE) is 		
has_substrate	The above would imply has_substrate would be useful too		
			
In conclusion			
There are a lot of inconsistant uses of the relationships			
It is going to take considerable time to go through and revise all these annotations			
Probably longer than it took to create the annotations in the first place			
			
Providing documentation on the use of the relationships and very good examples should be a priority to prevent continued (or new) inappropriate use of the relationships			
GOC should insist that curators do not use a relationship unless it conforms to standard example format, and that if someone wants to use the relationship in a new way then the example has to be checked by GO editor and included in the documentation before it is included in the annotation file			
Ideally much more specific rules about the domain and ranges would be included in annotation tools to limit use of the relationships			
For example:			
regulation_o_transports could be limited to most of the child terms of GO:0032879 regulation of localization, but not allowed for GO:0051270 regulation of cellular component movement etc			
regulates_o_has_agent could be limited to GO:0050790 regulation of catalytic activity and other terms or maybe broader:  GO:0050789 regulation of biological process
